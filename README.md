# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### My name is Josua Manalu. Feel free to call me Josua, Jos, or Jo!

I'm an Information Systems student, deeply passionate about web and Android development. Throughout my academic studies and additional courses, I have cultivated a love for these fields.

I am proficient in web development, with Laravel being my primary technology stack, a skill I acquired during my university years. It's not just my primary tech stack but a part of my tech arsenal that I truly enjoy working with.

I have diversified my skills by partaking in the Bangkit 2023 program, where I learnt Android development using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose.

Currently, I'm a participant in the GIGIH 3.0 program organized by GoTo Impact Foundation. Here, I'm enhancing my programming abilities and endeavoring to create a significant impact in the tech world.

Here are a few things about me:

-   ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on several web and mobile development projects.
-   ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m continually learning more about web and Android development.
-   ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m open to collaborating on Laravel and Android projects.
-   ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with advanced Kotlin concepts.
-   ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my journey into web and Android development!
-   âš¡ Fun fact: I often dream about solving coding errors. ðŸ˜‚
